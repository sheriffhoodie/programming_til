## SQL vs. MySQL vs. NoSQL

### NoSQL advantages and disadvantages:
Advantages
- Non-Relational means table-less: NoSQL databases are non-relational, hence, very different from SQL databases. This means they are easier to manage and they provide a higher level of flexibility with newer data models.
- Mostly Open Source and Low-Cost: The open source nature of NoSQL databases makes them an appealing solution for smaller organizations with limited budgets. The top NoSQL databases on the market today (MongoDB, MarkLogic, Couchbase, CloudDB, and Amazon’s Dynamo DB) allow for rapid processing of real-time Big Data applications in ways that are affordable.
- Easier scalability through support for Map Reduce: NoSQL database experts often use elastic scalability as a major selling point of NoSQL. NoSQL databases are designed to function on full throttle even with low-cost hardware.
- No need to develop a detailed database model: The non-relational nature of a NoSQL database allows database architects to quickly create a database without needing to develop a detailed (fine-grained) database model. This saves a lot of development time.
 
Disadvantages
- Community not as well defined: While its continuing to grow rapidly, the NoSQL community is relatively new and lacks the maturity of the MySQL user base. Obviously, NoSQL is growing rapidly, but for now MySQL is hard to beat for its vast network of highly experienced end users.
- Lack of reporting tools: A major problem with NoSQL databases is the lack of reporting tools for analysis and performance testing. However, with MySQL, you can find a wide array of reporting tools to help you prove your application’s validity.
- Lack of standardization: In order for NoSQL to grow, it needs a standard query language like SQL. This is a major issue highlighted by researchers at Microsoft, who claim that NoSQL’s lack of standardization can cause a problem during migration. Besides this, standardization is important for the database industry to unify itself in the future.

### Popular SQL databases and RDBMS’s
- MySQL — the most popular open-source database, excellent for CMS sites and blogs.
- Oracle — an object-relational DBMS written in the C++ language. If you have the budget, this is a full-service option with great customer service and reliability. Oracle has also released an Oracle NoSQL database.
- IMB DB2 — a family of database server products from IBM that are built to handle advanced “big data” analytics.
- Sybase — a relational model database server product for businesses primarily used on the Unix OS, which was the first enterprise-level DBMS for Linux.
- MS SQL Server — a Microsoft-developed RDBMS for enterprise-level databases that supports both SQL and NoSQL architectures.
- Microsoft Azure — a cloud computing platform that supports any operating system, and lets you store, compute, and scale data in one place. A recent survey even put it ahead of Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Storage for corporate data storage.
- MariaDB — an enhanced, drop-in version of MySQL.
- PostgreSQL — an enterprise-level, object-relational DBMS that uses procedural languages like Perl and Python, in addition to SQL-level code.
