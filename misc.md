### Traveling Salesman Problem
- an NP-complete problem, meaning the complexity class of decision problems for which answers can be checked for correctness, given a certificate, by an algorithm whose run time is polynomial in the size of the input (that is, it is NP) and no otherNP problem is more than a polynomial factor harder. An NP problem is one where a computer algorithm that verifies a solution can be created in polynomial time. an NP-Complete problem is NP, but also if you can solve it in polynomial time (called P) then all NP problems are P.
- in the problem, you’re given a list of cities and the distances between them and need to write an algorithm that returns the shortest possible route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the origin city\
